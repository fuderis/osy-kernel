<h1 align="center">Osy AGENT_NAME Agent</h1>
<p align="center">
  <strong>Local ... agent for Osy Kernel</strong><br>
</p>

## Overview

**Osy AGENT_NAME** is a specialized modular agent for the **[Osy Kernel](https://github.com/fuderis/osy-kernel)** ecosystem, providing ... over lightning-fast IPC.

---

## Dependencies

Osy agents are structured within the kernel's Cargo workspace.

This design shares foundational core crates (`rigging`, `pearce`, `cistern`, `anylm`, etc.) across all services,
ensuring consistent types, optimal binary size, and unified dependencies while keeping agents in independent repositories.

---

## Installation

1. Clone agent repository into the `agents/` directory in the root of your local **Osy Kernel** source tree:

```bash
cd .../osy/agents
git clone https://github.com/fuderis/osy-agent_name.git agent_name
```

2. Navigate back to root and run the installation command:

```bash
cd ..
make install-agent name=agent_name
```

or install all agents located in the `agents/` folder at once:

```bash
make install-agents
```
